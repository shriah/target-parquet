### Configure using environment variables

This Singer target will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.

### Source Authentication and Authorization


## Usage

You can easily run `target-parquet` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Target Directly

```bash
target-parquet --version
target-parquet --help
# Test using the "Carbon Intensity" sample:
tap-carbon-intensity | target-parquet --config /path/to/target-parquet-config.json
```

## Developer Resources

Follow these instructions to contribute to this project.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `target-parquet` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run target-parquet --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://meltano.com/)

_**Note:** This target will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd target-parquet
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke target-parquet --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline with the Carbon Intensity sample tap:
meltano run tap-carbon-intensity target-parquet
```
